/*!
 * Description: The application entry point module
 *
 * When the application starts, it creates a Redux store with the application's reducer. *
 *
 * Notice that the code sets the Redux store to an App property of the same name.
 *
 * Notice, we use subscription to the redux store on a component level , which is better than letting the App component
 * subscribe on the whole redux store. In the components that subscribe to the redux store we use react forceUpdate
 * when the store changes.
